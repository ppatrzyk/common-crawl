            Analysis of language prevalence in the internet.
            List of languages was parsed and aggregated by host to determine <em>primary</em> (i.e., the most common one on the host) and <em>secondary</em> language(s) of each website.
            See <a href="https://github.com/ppatrzyk/common-crawl">ppatrzyk/common-crawl</a> for details on how data was queried and processed.
            Known limitations: 
            (i) it's unknown whether data source constitutes representative sample of the entire internet, 
            (ii) languages were determined automatically with unknown reliability [<a href="https://commoncrawl.org/blog/august-2018-crawl-archive-now-available">details</a>],
            (iii) map visualization was prepared with default <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/">plotly</a> map data - depending on your local laws, country borders might be inaccurate.
